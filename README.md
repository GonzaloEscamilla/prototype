## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to prototyping various game ideas and mechanics. It serves as a sandbox environment where we can quickly implement and test new concepts without the overhead of a full game development cycle.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project locally on your machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Unity](https://unity.com/) (version 2022.3.31f1 LTS)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Ready to have a blast making games

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prototype.git
    cd just-another-prototyping-repository
    ```

2. **Open the project in Unity:**

    - Launch Unity Hub.
    - Click on "Add" and select the cloned project directory.
    - Open the project in Unity.

## Usage

Once the project is open in Unity, you can playtest the prototypes directly from the Unity Editor. Each prototype is contained within its own scene, which can be found in the `Scenes` directory. Simply open a scene and click the "Play" button in Unity to start testing.
